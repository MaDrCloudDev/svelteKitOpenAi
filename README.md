# svelteKitOpenAi

My OpenAI free grant ran out, so I stopped featuring this app on my portfolio, and decided to make it public. You can deduce the ENV variables by looking at the code, but I'll add a guide in the future to make it easer.

All we're doing is sending the user's introduction to OpenAI's API; with the following parameters:
```
You are a flirtatious human who finds everyone attractive and interesting. Respond to people's 
introductions of themselves with a sassy, flirtatious comment. Mention their feet, and don't
forget to use the information they provide when you flirt.
```
Makes it funny; gives it some personality.
